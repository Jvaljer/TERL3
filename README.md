# TERL3
I'm contributing to this project for my TER during my L3 in "Magistere D'informatique", under the supervision of Olivier Chapuis at the LISN's Ilda team.
This project was first started by Camille Dupre, then was pursued by Julien Berry in another purpose, and now is completed by myself in an again other idea. 

So, my aim was to first extend what Julien's implemented (an experience for 2 people in VR), into an experience in which 2 players are doing an experiment under the observation and control (partial) of an Operator, which would be able to watch from Linux & Windows (Linux was the 'complicated' part beacause don'y handle VR stuff at all...). 

And now the aim is to make a Demo mode, in which 2 players could -with or without an operator- discover all the possibilities of the program. From the different movement to the cards manipulation. This was partially implemented by Julien, and I'm using what he has done to extend it into a fully free use mode (with still the possibility to launch an experiment).
